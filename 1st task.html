			<p><h2><u><b>Eat more fruits and vegetables</b></u></h2></p>
				<p>Fruit and vegetables are good for our health, and most come with a low environmental impact. There are exceptions, as some require a lot of resources to transport and keep fresh, so eating these less frequently can increase the sustainability of our diets. Examples include:<br>

				<mark><br>fruits and vegetables that are fragile, or require refrigeration (salads and berries) </mark><br>vegetables that are grown in protected conditions (such as hot-house tomatoes or cucumbers) <br>Foodsthat use a lot of resources during transport (green beans, mange-touts, or berries imported from the southern hemisphere).<br><del>Oily,fast-food,alchohole is danger for health</del></p>
		
		<p><h2><u><b> Avoid eating more than needed, especially treats</b></u></h2></P>
		
<p>1.Consuming only what we need reduces demands on our food supply by decreasing excess production. 
<br>
2.It also helps to keep us healthy and avoid excessive weight gain. 
<br>
3.Limiting snacking on energy-dense low-nutrient foods and paying attention to portion sizes are all useful ways to avoid unnecessary overconsumption.</p>

<p><h2><u><b>Eat dairy products in moderation</h2></u></b></p>
<p>While milk and dairy production has an important environmental impact, dairy products are an important source of protein, calcium and essential amino acids, and have been linked to reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, stroke, bowel cancer and type 2 diabetes.<br>

Enjoy low-fat unsweetened dairy products daily, but in moderation.<br>
Limit consumption of high-fat cheeses to occasional.<br>
For those of us who choose to eliminate dairy completely, opt for plant-based drinks that are fortified with vitamins and minerals, like calcium.</p>

<p><h2><u><b>Drink tap water</h2></u></b></p>
<p>In Europe, the standards of water quality and safety are high. Instead of buying bottled water, we can re-fill a reusable water bottle at the tap as many times as we want. Tap water costs a fraction of the price of bottled water and reduces our ecological footprint.</p>
